Hey everyone! I'm super excited to share with you a little project I've been working on: a vanilla JS custom hook to manage state framework agnostic. What does that mean? It means you can use this hook to create and update state variables in any JavaScript framework, such as React, Vue, Angular, etc. without relying on their specific APIs. This hook is inspired by React's useState hook, but it works with plain JavaScript functions and objects. Let me show you how it works and why it's useful.
